# Debug Fixes Summary

## Issues Resolved

### 1. npm watch task error: "Could not find the task '/Users/wavegoodvybe/GitHub/Swarm-Extension:npm: watch'"

**Root Cause**: Malformed VS Code task configuration in `.vscode/tasks.json` using deprecated npm task type format.

**Solution**: Updated tasks.json to use proper shell-based task configuration:
- Changed from `"type": "npm"` to `"type": "shell"`
- Added explicit `"command": "npm"` and `"args": ["run", "watch"]`
- Added proper labels for each task
- Improved presentation settings for better user experience

**Files Modified**:
- `.vscode/tasks.json` - Complete rewrite with proper task configuration

### 2. LM Studio configuration settings and chat not displaying

**Root Cause**: Multiple issues preventing LM Studio integration from working properly:
1. Missing command registration for `ruv-swarm.openLMStudioChat`
2. Missing configuration property `autoConnect` in settings schema
3. Poor error handling during auto-connection attempts
4. Lack of user feedback when connection fails

**Solutions Implemented**:

#### A. Added Missing Command Registration
- Added `ruv-swarm.openLMStudioChat` command to package.json contributes.commands section

#### B. Fixed Configuration Schema
- Added missing `autoConnect` property to `ruv-swarm.lmstudio.connection` configuration
- Updated default values to include the new property

#### C. Improved Error Handling and User Feedback
- Enhanced auto-connection logic in `src/extension.ts`
- Added specific error messages for different connection failure scenarios
- Provided actionable user prompts with buttons to:
  - Open LM Studio settings
  - Try connecting again
  - View logs for debugging

**Files Modified**:
- `package.json` - Added missing command and configuration property
- `src/extension.ts` - Improved error handling and user feedback

## Testing Results

### npm watch task
✅ **FIXED**: The watch task now runs successfully without errors
- Command `npm run watch` executes properly
- TypeScript compilation in watch mode is working
- No more malformed task identifier errors

### LM Studio Integration
✅ **IMPROVED**: Better error handling and user feedback
- Missing command registration resolved
- Configuration schema is now complete
- Users will receive clear feedback when LM Studio is not running
- Actionable error messages guide users to resolve connection issues

## How to Test the Fixes

### Test npm watch task:
1. Open VS Code in the extension directory
2. Run `npm run watch` in terminal - should work without errors
3. Or use VS Code's Task Runner (Ctrl+Shift+P → "Tasks: Run Task" → "npm: watch")

### Test LM Studio Integration:
1. Open Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P)
2. Search for "Open LM Studio Chat" - command should be available
3. If LM Studio is not running, you should see helpful error messages
4. Check extension settings for LM Studio configuration options

## Additional Improvements Made

1. **Better Task Configuration**: All npm tasks now use consistent shell-based configuration
2. **Enhanced Error Messages**: More specific and actionable error messages for connection failures
3. **Improved User Experience**: Clear guidance when LM Studio is not available
4. **Configuration Completeness**: All referenced configuration properties are now properly defined

## Files Changed Summary

- `.vscode/tasks.json` - Fixed npm task configuration
- `package.json` - Added missing command and configuration property
- `src/extension.ts` - Improved error handling and user feedback

All changes maintain backward compatibility and improve the overall user experience.
